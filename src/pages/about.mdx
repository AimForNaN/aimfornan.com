Aim for NaN stems from the idea of refusing to be just another number in this world.
I'll be honest: It becomes tiring watching so many people waste away in this world, who seem to have no intention or desire for self improvement.
And that includes myself.
Worse still is watching the very same complain about their own situation while doing nothing about it.
The issue, more often than not, isn't lacking the capacity to make a difference.
The issue is being unwilling to make an effort.

For as long as the breath of life abide in you, your capacity to make an effort towards making a difference in your life is the same as anyone elses.
The amount of energy that the average person has at their disposal significantly surpasses that of my own.
It is simply a waste, and on some level an insult, to spend it all on nothing.
Worse still are those who use that energy to do foolish things.
Better to do nothing than to do something foolish.
But better still is to do something worthy of doing than nothing at all.

## This is what people with energy do.

Social media is full of things that people with energy do, from the most wholesome to the most depressing, and everything in between.
There is no shortage of things to do on this earth, and if it could be done, then it probably has already been done.
Take a step back for just a moment and observe it all.
Contemplate carefully on what you see and say to yourself, &ldquo;*This* is what people with energy do.&rdquo;
After coming to this realization, ask yourself perhaps the most life-changing question that anyone might ever ask themselves.

> **Is this really what *I* want to do?**

Indeed, take notice of the fact that you had to spend valuable time doing nothing but viewing social media before you ever considered self-reflection. 
Likewise, take notice of the fact that perhaps prior to this moment you would find yourself fully engaged in social media.
Take part in the practice of introverts known as introspection.
Think about all the years that have gone by and what you have been doing and what you have seen others do.
&ldquo;This is what people with energy do.&rdquo;

Out of all the things that people with energy do, what was the most worthy of doing?
What can you bring to the world?
And what do you have to offer to yourself?
&ldquo;Nothing&rdquo; is not answer except for those who are unwilling to make an effort.
Shall one wallow in self pity that they might fulfill their desire of least effort?
Or shall they recognize that they have two hands and two feet?
&ldquo;This is what people with energy do.&rdquo;

## Welcome to my world.

I am functionally bedbound and practically housebound.
I suffer from a plethora of symptoms, some of which cause me physical pain daily.
My energy levels are about one-third to one-fourth that of a normal person, though sometimes it feels like even less than that.
I use a rolling walker to get around the house and am unfit for travel.
The doctors I had seen couldn't find anything wrong with me; all tests came back unremarkable.
I say these things as a matter of fact, not to play the victim.

I've spent several years researching, experimenting, and running tests on myself in an attempt to figure out what's wrong with me.
From my ordeals I have come to understand a lot about the human body, especially my own.
If I had known years ago what I know today I could have prevented and possibly completely reversed my condition.
Yet, had I not gone through all of this, I would not have the knowledge and understanding that I do today.
Despite my condition, I wouldn't want to live a different life.

The knowledge and understanding that I've obtained as a result of my sufferings is too valuable to let it die with me.
As such, I've sought to document my findings and provide them free of charge for others to learn.
To live a different life is to erase all that I have learned, even who I am.
I refuse to let it all go to waste.
And I refuse to be just another number in this world.
Yet, I don't seek to be remembered.
I merely seek for people to stop settling for less while having the energy to do more.

Make an effort. **Aim for NaN.**
