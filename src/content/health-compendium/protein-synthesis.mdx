People consume on average around 1% of total-body protein a day.
Mathematically, at 1% of total-body protein a day,
it could take around 3 months to reach 100% of total-body protein through diet alone.
However, on average, people tend to recover from disease in about six months.
This suggests that the body uses around half of the protein consumed towards healing.
This may also suggest that people aren't consuming as much protein as they should.

Studies suggest that a minimum of 30 grams of protein is required to induce protein synthesis.
However, one should not focus so much on reaching 30 grams of protein,
since everyone's dietary needs are different and the mechanisms were not revealed in these studies.
All you need to know is that if you want to induce protein synthesis,
you're going to need a significant amount of nutrition.

## Nutritional factors

Inducing protein synthesis requires more than the consumption of protein.
You're going to need several vitamins and minerals to go along with the protein.
Some of these nutrients will be necessary for the production of ATP used in protein synthesis,
activating vitamin D, producing T3, among other things.
For the best possible results, you're going to want to include the following nutrients:

 - B vitamins
 - Calcium
 - Iodine
 - Magnesium
 - Vitamin C
 - Vitamin D
 - Zinc
