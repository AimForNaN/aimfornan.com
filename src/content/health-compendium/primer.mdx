&ldquo;You are what you eat&rdquo; misses an extremely important fact.

> **Nutrition takes a backseat when it comes to the microbiome.**

When the microbiome work in your favor you are better able to extract nutrients from food, resulting in a significant and positive impact on your health.
When they work against you malnutrition and disease will soon follow.
You are like a bush planted into the ground: with good soil you grow large and produce much fruit.
And this good soil is filled with microbes that have a positive impact on their environment. 
Bad soil will cause the plant to wither and die.

The body is only able to digest a portion of the foods you consume.
Without the help of the microbiome you may find yourself malnourished, especially when faced with disease.
The mantra of health shouldn't be, &ldquo;you are what you eat.&rdquo;
Rather, the mantra of health should be, &ldquo;you are what lives inside you.&rdquo; 
And what lives inside you includes your organs and the microbes within those organs.
For as long as they're working in your favor you'll experience good health.

## What does it mean to be healthy?

Health shouldn't be limited to being without an illness or disease.
Health should also include the capacity to fend off any illness or the rate at which one recovers from disease.
If there is anything that COVID-19 has taught us, it is this:

> **A large portion of humanity is malnourished.**

Given the fact that the gut microbiome can significantly reduce the amount of time spent sick and synthesize certain nutrients, COVID-19 reveals all the more that a large portion of society have low-quality gut microbiome.
Infections both reduce the number of resources the body has to work with and negatively impacts the gut microbiome.
This negative impact on the gut is not necessarily simple to recover from.
Being malnourished simply makes everything that much worse.

Health, therefore, in its simplified state, is comprised of a strong and nourished system with a strong and nourished microbiome.

## The real meaning of diet

Fads and constant misinformation have confused the understanding of what a diet really is. 
&ldquo;I'm on a diet&rdquo; adds to this confusion.
Let's be real here: everyone is on a diet, whether they admit to one or not.
A diet isn't a restriction that you place on the foods and drinks you consume.
A diet is what you are consuming at the current time.
A diet is simply &ldquo;what you eat.&rdquo;

## What constitutes a healthy diet?

You'd be surprised as to how many people can't provide an answer to this question.
And for those that attempt to answer, they reveal that they are not suitable to give nutritional or health advice.
