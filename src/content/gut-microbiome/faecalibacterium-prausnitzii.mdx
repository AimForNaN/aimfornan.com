title: "Faecalibacterium Prausnitzii"
category: microbes
---

One of the main butyrate-producing bacteria in the human gut.
It is highly sensitive to oxygen.
One of its main sources of fuel is the acetate produced by other microbes.
Therefore, if acetate levels are low, you can expect its abundance to be low, too.
