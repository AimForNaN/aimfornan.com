GERD for short, is when stomach acid is pushed backwards into the esophagus, causing great discomfort or injury.
Gastric pressure and pH levels often control how the lower esophageal sphincter reacts and functions.
During digestion, the stomach will contract, churning the food.
Likewise, the small intestine induces contractions, known as "segmentation,"
which churns the chyme (i.e. partially digested food), allowing for increased digestion and absorption.
During these contractions an increase in gut pressure can occur.

If pressure exists further down the line, the chyme may be pushed backwards as the system tries to move things forward.
This build up of pressure, however, can start as far as the large intestine, working its way up the ileum,
the jejunum, the duodenum, and into the stomach.
This chain of backed-up pressure is often caused by gut dysbiosis,
which itself can induce maldigestion (therefore, malabsorption), constipation, among other things, backing things up even more.
Gut dysbiosis is a vicious cycle, leading to a worsening of symptoms the longer it goes on.

Healthy subjects have enough room for pressure to stabilize, removing opportunity for things to get backed up.
Their microbiome works in harmony with their digestive system, allowing for food to be digested effectively and in a timely manner.
Therefore, it is not surprising to see benefit from an increase in acid, rather than a decrease, for those experiencing acid reflux.
That is, anything that aids digestion may provide relief.
