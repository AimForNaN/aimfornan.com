You exit the womb and are exposed to your first batch of microbes.
Some time thereafter "immunization" is performed on you.
Minimal breast-feeding (e.g. no more than three months; dairy substitutions included; etc) and a poor diet are your sources of nutrition.
During this time your brain is developing significantly, at a rate of 1% a day for the first three months, and 0.4% thereafter.[^1]
Because of your inability to properly communicate, no one is the wiser as to how you are developing.
During this time, endotoxins produced by the microbiome have been entering the blood stream, negatively impacting brain development.
