Granular injury to the kidneys can lead to the formation of hard objects known as kidney stones.
The exact causes of kidney injury are various, though inflammation is typically present in most cases.
The stones themselves can lead to further kidney injury, introducing a vicious cycle.
Many people may go about their lives never knowing that a kidney stone has formed within their kidneys,
not experiencing any symptoms, which may even resolve on their own.

## Potential treatments

### Fenugreek seed

Many people have had good success reversing their kidney stones by consuming Fenugreek seed preparations.
The exact mechanisms are unknown, but I would argue multiple mechanisms are at work, especially as it pertains to the gut.
Fenugreek seed is known to help reduce inflammation of the gut as it forms a protective layer, and acts as a prebiotic for beneficial bacteria,
helping to reduce overall, systemic inflammation.
