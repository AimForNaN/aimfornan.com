Ever woken up from a dream whose influence remains though having awakened?
Or ever been hypnotized and made to imagine things that aren't there?
Then you have gained insight into the world of a schizophrenic&mdash;albeit an oversimplification.
The difference between us and them is that our minds are capable of turning it off.
For the schizophrenic the switch insists on being on.
Something occurs within their system that turns the switch on and blocks access to the switch.

Assuming family history, people are inclined to assert genetics as a cause.
However, genes aren't the only thing passed down from parent to child.
It should be stated that most neurological diseases are caused by the gut microbiome,
and schizophrenia is no exception.
