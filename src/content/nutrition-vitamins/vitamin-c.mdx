title: Vitamin C
---

One of the many essential nutrients which are necessary for the many daily functions of the body.
It is a nutrient that goes highly unrecognized, where even the recommended daily allowance fails to do it justice.
Even body builders neglect this nutrient, despite it being necessary for protein synthesis.
Those looking for smooth, healthy skin will be hard-pressed to achieve it without this nutrient.

During times of disease, vitamin C gets depleted quickly, as do many other antioxidants.
So much so that people with chronic disease are likely to experience mild cases of scurvy without realizing it.
This is especially true in cases of edema, where capillaries have been significantly damaged.
Even wounds would take longer to heal without this nutrient.

## Dosage

Seemingly-healthy individuals should take about 1 gram a day (i.e. 500 mg, twice a day).
Those suffering from chronic disease should take at least 2 grams a day (i.e. 500 mg, four times a day).
