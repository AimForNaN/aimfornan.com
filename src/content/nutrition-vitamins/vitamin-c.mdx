One of the many essential nutrients which are necessary for the many daily functions of the body.
It is a nutrient that goes highly unrecognized, where even the recommended daily allowance fails to do it justice.
Body builders that neglect this nutrient do themselves a disservice, since it is necessary for protein synthesis.
Those looking for smooth, healthy skin will be hard-pressed to achieve it without this nutrient.

During times of disease, vitamin C gets depleted quickly, as do many other antioxidants.
So much so that people with chronic disease are likely to experience mild cases of scurvy without realizing it.
This is especially true in cases of edema, where capillaries have been significantly damaged.
Wounds would take longer to heal without this nutrient.

## Dosage

Seemingly-healthy individuals should take about 1 gram a day (i.e. 500 mg, twice a day).
Those suffering from chronic disease should take at least 2 grams a day (i.e. 500 mg, four times a day).
Vitamin C should be obtained only from natural sources.
Supplements of powdered fruit are available online.
Avoid supplements whose source is "ascorbic acid."

## Contraindications

This only applies to ascorbic acid, especially when taken through IV.
When electrons are depleted, a pro-oxidant effect is possible.
Granted, this is a very weak pro-oxidant, and is rarely a thing to worry about.
Nevertheless, when such large amounts are present, as in the case of IV, the effect may be strengthened.

Ascorbic acid is eventually converted into oxalates in the body, and is later excreted.[^1]
Those whose bodies are negatively impacted by oxalates should avoid ascorbic acid, especially in large amounts.
