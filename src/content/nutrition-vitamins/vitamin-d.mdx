The active form is called calcitriol (specifically 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D).
The inactive forms are called cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) or ergocalciferol (vitamin D2).
The inactive form can be produced when certain sun rays make direct contact with the skin.
Dietary sources and supplementation tend to also contain the inactive form.

The inactive forms are processed by the liver where it is converted into calcidiol (specifically 25-hydroxyvitamin D).
Then the kidneys before it is converted into its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.
Magnesium is one of the main nutrients necessary for this conversion to take place.

## Protein synthesis

Apart from absorbing and helping to regulate blood calcium levels,
vitamin D is necessary for synthesizing many kinds of protein.
Any body-builder or anyone with lung injury, gut problems, infection, etc, that leaves this nutrient out of their diet does themselves a disservice.
Skeletal muscle, gut lining, lung lining, bladder lining, etc, are all proteins influenced by vitamin D.
