## DIY procedure

For the most viable diversity you'll need to prepare the sample under anaerobic conditions.
An anaerobic chamber is useful here.
However, since an anaerobic chamber is fairly expensive,
depending on the method of entry, you'll likely have to risk losing viability to an aerobic environment.
Preparing the sample for anal entry via an enema will likely result in the most loss in viability.
Less viability also means less diversity.
For that reason, we recommend oral entry through capsules.

Best case scenario, you'll want to prepare the stool sample within 15 minutes after exiting the donor's body.
If this is not possible, we recommend storing the stool sample within a vacuum-sealable ziploc-like bag.
For good measure you can toss in an oxygen absorber packet prior to sucking the air out of the bag.

### Enema

To prepare the stool sample for an enema you'll have to blend it in a blender with a saline solution.
A phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution is recommended.
Once blended, you'll want to strain out any potential solids with a sieve.
Because the entire process significantly exposes the microbes to oxygen,
you should only prepare the sample if you plan on performing the enema immediately thereafter.
As such, it should be expected to require multiple enemas to see significant changes to the recipient's microbiome.

### Capsules

Because the blending part is unnecessary for oral administration, we recommend capsule preparations over an enema.
Given correct applications of a protectant medium,
oral administration is likely to yield better results when using samples from a healthy donor
since it is assumed to have greater viability.

## Storage

For the most viable diversity you'll need to use some kind of protectant medium.
Something as simple as skim milk and sugar (e.g. sucrose, trehalose, etc) can be used for storing in fridge (4&deg;C).
If storing in the freezer (-20&deg;C), you'll want to use an antifreeze protectant medium (e.g. maltodextrin).
The protectant medium should allow for fairly long storage durations with very little loss in viability.
Do note that each method has its pros and cons,
and long-term storage could lead to an adjustment in microbiome ratios (i.e. loss of diversity).

## Transportation

The goal is to maintain viability with as much diversity as possible.
The ones to worry about the most are anaerobic microbes.

## Safety

When dealing with microbes of all kinds there will always be the potential for problems.
The gut itself harbors at least 100 trillion different microbes.
There's a chance of getting better.
There's a chance of nothing happening, whether good or bad.
There's a chance of getting worse.
And there's a chance of death.
One should not so blindly entertain fecal microbiota transplants.
We have not yet identified all the microbes in existence, and we likely never will since the task is too great.
