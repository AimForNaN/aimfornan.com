## DIY procedure

For the most viable diversity you'll need to prepare the sample under anaerobic conditions.
An anaerobic chamber is useful here.
However, since an anaerobic chamber is fairly expensive,
depending on the method of entry, you'll likely have to risk losing viability to an aerobic environment.
Preparing the sample for anal entry via an enema will likely result in the most loss in viability.
For that reason, we recommend oral entry through capsules.

## Storage

For the most viable diversity you'll need to use some kind of protectant medium.
Something as simple as skim milk and sugar (e.g. sucrose, trehalose, etc) can be used for storing in fridge (4&deg;C).
If storing in the freezer (-20&deg;C), you'll want to use an antifreeze protectant medium (e.g. maltodextrin).
The protectant medium should allow for fairly long storage durations.
Do note that each method has its pros and cons, and long-term storage could lead to an adjustment in microbiome ratios.
