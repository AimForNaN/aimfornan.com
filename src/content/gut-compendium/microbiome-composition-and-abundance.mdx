title: Microbiome composition and abundance
published: true

Microbiome composition relates to all the microbes that currently inhabit your gut.
Abundance relates to their ratios, that is, the relative quantities in relation to all their neighbors.
Understanding composition and abundance is key to understanding why something might work for someone but not for another.
Why diet and supplementation may alter abundance for one person and not for another.
And why the advice or treatments you receive from medical and health professionals may not work for you, though it may work for others.
