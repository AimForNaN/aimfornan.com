LPS for short, found on the outer membrane of gram-negative microbes, consists of three parts:
Lipid A, an inner core oligosaccharide, and an outer core polysaccharide O-antigen.
They are generally classified as endotoxins, activating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
when they bind to certain receptors (i.e. TLR4, CD14, MD2) of the host.
Through natural cell growth and cell death, LPS are synthesized and released into the environment,
where cell death releasing greater amounts of LPS.

## Inhibition

Some gram-negative bacteria can produce LPS that can act as antagonists to the LPS produced by other gram-negative bacteria.
This can be done by binding to the receptors of the host before any other LPS can bind to them.
These tend to have a weaker effect on the host's immune system and are less likely to induce an immune response.
Other gram-negative bacteria, like E. coli, produce stronger forms of LPS
which are typically the ones to an induce many kinds of immune responses.[^1]

### Lactoferrin

Iron is a necessary nutrient in the production of LPS by many gram-negative bacteria.
Apolactoferrin can bind to iron, preventing many bacteria from utilizing iron, especially gram-negative bacteria,
without preventing the body from absorbing iron.

### Fruits

Some fruits contain proanthocyanidins (PACs) that bind to LPS, inhibiting the ability of LPS to bind to host receptors.
Grape seed and cranberry extracts are rich in PACs that are known to bind and neutralize the LPS produced by gram-negative bacteria.
Since the membrane of gram-negative bacteria are made up of LPS,
these PACs can disrupt the structure and functions of some gram-negative bacteria,
preventing them from utilizing the iron necessary for producing LPS.
Conversely, these same PACs can increase the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, which consist mostly of gram-negative bacteria.
