LPS for short, found on the outer membrane of gram-negative microbes, consists of three parts:
Lipid A, an inner core oligosaccharide, and an outer core polysaccharide O-antigen.
They are generally classified as endotoxins, activating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
when they bind to certain receptors (i.e. TLR4, CD14, MD2).
Through natural cell growth and cell death, LPS are synthesized and released into the environment,
where cell death releasing greater amounts of LPS.
